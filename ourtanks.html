						<h4>Challenger 2</h4>     <img src="img/challenger2.jpg" alt="Challenger 2" class="saleimg"></td>
						<td>The Challenger 2 is equipped with a 120-millimetre (4.7 in) 55-calibre long L30A1 tank gun, the successor to the L11 gun used on Chieftain and Challenger 1.
							The gun is made from high strength electro-slag remelting (ESR) steel with a chromium alloy lining and, like earlier British 120 mm guns, it is insulated by a thermal sleeve.
							It is fitted with a muzzle reference system and fume extractor, and is controlled by an all-electric control and stabilisation system. The turret has a rotation time of 9 seconds through 360 degrees.

					<tr>
						<td><h4>Type 10</h4><img src="img/type10.jpg" alt="Type 10" class="saleimg"></td>
						<td>Type 10 uses a completely new gun, developed indigenously by Japan Steel Works. There is an option for longer barrels of 50 and 55 calibers (L50, L55). The Type 10's new cannon can fire the normal JSDF-developed JM33 APFSDS as well as all standard 120 mm NATO ammunition.
							One major improvement over the earlier Rheinmetall L44 cannon is that this new JSW gun mounted on the Type 10 tank can also fire an improved round, the newly developed: Type 10 APFSDS round, which is specifically designed for and can only be fired by the Type 10
						</td>
						<td>&pound;6,368,461</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><h4>T-90</h4><img src="img/t90.jpg" alt="T-90" class="saleimg"></td>
						<td>The T-90's main armament is the 2A46M 125mm smoothbore tank gun. This is a highly modified version of the Sprut anti-tank gun, and is the same gun used as the main armament on the T-80-series tanks.
							It can be replaced without dismantling the inner turret and is capable of firing armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS), high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT-FS), and high explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG)
							ammunition, as well as 9M119M Refleks anti-tank guided missiles. The Refleks missile has semi-automatic laser beam-riding guidance and a tandem hollow-charge HEAT warhead.
						It has an effective range of 100 m to 6 km, and takes 17.5 seconds to reach maximum range. Refleks can penetrate about 950 millimetres (37 in) of steel armour and can also engage low-flying air targets such as helicopters.</td>
						<td>&pound;3,411,675</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><h4>Leopard 2</h4><img src="img/leopard2.jpg" alt="Leopard 2" class="saleimg"></td>
						<td>The primary armament for production versions of the Leopard 2 is the Rheinmetall 120 mm smoothbore gun - the same gun currently used on the M1 Abrams - in either the L/44 variant (found on all production Leopard 2s until the A5), or the L/55 variant (as found on the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent models).
							Ammunition for the gun comprises 27 rounds stored in a special magazine in the forward section of the hull, to the left of the driver's station, with an additional 15 rounds stored in the left side of the turret bustle, which are separated from the fighting compartment by an electrically operated door.
						</td>
						<td>&pound;4,351,781</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><h4>Panzer 4</h4><img src="img/panzer4.jpg" alt="Panzer 4" class="saleimg"></td>
						<td>As main armament, the vehicle mounted the short-barreled, howitzer-like 75 mm (2.95 in) Kampfwagenkanone 37 L/24 (7.5 cm KwK 37 L/24) tank gun, which was a low-velocity weapon mainly designed to fire high-explosive shells.
							Against armored targets, firing the Panzergranate (armor-piercing shell) at 430 metres per second (1,410 ft/s) the KwK 37 could penetrate 43 millimetres (1.69 in), inclined at 30 degrees, at ranges of up to 700 metres (2,300 ft).
							A 7.92 mm (0.31 in) MG 34 machine gun was mounted coaxially with the main weapon in the turret, while a second machine gun of the same type was mounted in the front plate of the hull.
							The main weapon and coaxial machine gun were sighted with a Turmzielfernrohr 5b optic while the hull machine gun was sighted with a Kugelzielfernrohr 2 optic.
